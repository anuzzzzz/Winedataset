FAIRNESS ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
‚Ä¢ Location 0 Accuracy: 1.0000
‚Ä¢ Location 1 Accuracy: 1.0000
‚Ä¢ Accuracy Difference: 0.0000

üìä INTERPRETATION:
‚Ä¢ Values close to 0 indicate fair treatment across groups
‚Ä¢ Accuracy difference measures performance parity
‚Ä¢ Lower differences suggest more equitable outcomes

üîç FINDINGS:
‚úÖ EXCELLENT: Very low accuracy difference suggests fair treatment

üìã DETAILED ANALYSIS:

The synthetic location attribute was used to simulate a sensitive
demographic feature for fairness assessment. The analysis shows:

‚Ä¢ Group sizes: Location 0 and Location 1 samples
‚Ä¢ Performance parity: 0.0000 accuracy difference
‚Ä¢ Class-level fairness: Analyzed for each wine cultivar

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Continue monitoring fairness metrics in production
2. Collect more balanced demographic data if possible
3. Consider fairness constraints if bias is detected
4. Regular auditing of predictions across groups
5. Implement explanation interfaces for transparency

üî¨ METHODOLOGY:
‚Ä¢ Synthetic location attribute as sensitive feature
‚Ä¢ Multi-class classification fairness assessment
‚Ä¢ Group-wise accuracy comparison
‚Ä¢ Class-level fairness analysis
‚Ä¢ Statistical parity evaluation

‚úÖ CONCLUSION:

The wine classification model demonstrates fair treatment across
location groups with minimal accuracy disparity, suggesting that
the model's decisions are primarily based on wine chemical
properties rather than location bias.
